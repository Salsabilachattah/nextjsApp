This is my first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web application 

## To run the app locally
- First , create a .env file and add your API_KEY (for the ipify API) and your token (for fast-api-speedtest API) to it
- Next , install dependencies using :
```bash 
npm install
```
- Next, build the app and run the development server using these commands
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to test the application

## What functionnalities does the website offer ?

The website was mainly developed to show you your public ip address as well as some relevant information , but you can also use it to :

- Search for any given public ip address .
- Test your internet download speed.

## used public APIs

- I used [https://geo.ipify.org/docs](ipify) for getting both personnal ip address and searched ip address relative information .
- I used netflix's [https://fast.com/fr/](https://fast.com/fr/) API for internet speed test .
